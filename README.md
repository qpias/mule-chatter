This is my experimental project creating a Mule ESB connector for Salesforce Chatter API. It is basically a Mule wrapper for the https://github.com/forcedotcom/JavaChatterRESTApi Java Chatter client.

It is currently usable only for sending text and links to the feed of specified Chatter user, you'll just have to include the jar for the Java client as well. The Java client is currently added as a provided dependency in Maven, in case you want to start playing around  with this. The required jars can be found in the target folder, however. See the test for example usage and see SF Chatter docs for instructions to authorize the Chatter API in SF.
